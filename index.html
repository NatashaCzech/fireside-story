    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The branches in the trees creaked and moaned like old, tired people trying to get comfortable.<br></br>
      Not like the old person that lives on your street, more like Tales From the Crypt kinda old. Ya, dig?</p>
      <p>Whiffs of ancient fumes slithered through the dark spaces between and beneath the shadows.</p>
      <h2><strong>THE END</strong></h2>
